# OBS Settings for Bitrate Calculator

[OBS Lua Script](https://obsproject.com/docs/scripting.html) to calculate best resolution or frame rate for a target bitrate.

## Usage

- Changing Resolution will try to find the best FPS, and vice-versa.
- Bitrate, Resolution, and FPS should be initialized from OBS, you may need to use *Capture OBS Settings* as they are not necessarily accurate at startup.
- When editing text controls, you must press *Refresh* to updated calculated fields.
